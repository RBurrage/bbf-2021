					<p>If you have peeked into the boxing gym window thinking "I wish I had the guts to do that," now is your chance to get in on the action with Team Training, our 3-month program that offers the opportunity for beginners to train like boxers.</p>

                    <img src="assets/img/bg-slides/21a.jpg" class="full-image" />
					<p>Learn all the footwork, speed, explosion, offense and defense drills that the elite level boxers work on as they prepare to fight. Work one-on-one with men and women of the same experience level on safe and controlled sparring drills. Those who continuously improve over 3 months will be invited to step into the ring in April and May to participate in Fight Nights.</p> 

					<p>Team Training starts with 2 weeks of boot camp meeting three times a week. After boot camp concludes, the group is split into two teams. Members are expected to attend all team practices on Tuesday or Thursday, and every Saturday. Saturdays are competition days where both teams compete against each other in different fitness tests for points. The team with the highest points at the end of the three months will be crowned Team Training Champion. Team Training culminates in two fight night events, the  Fight Night Qualifier and the Fight Night Finale.</p> 

					<p>Signups are at the front desk in the gym. You must be a member in good standing to join and must have your standard membership paid up through May.</p> 

					<p>Team Training is open to all levels, from beginners to advanced boxers. Team Training is open to the public with the purchase of a three month membership.</p>

					<p>Team Training sessions are conducted twice a year, from February to April and from September to November. There is a show at the end of each session,  with shows occurring in April and December.</p>
                    <p>Team Training is a 3-month program concluding with a Fight Night in November where boxers fight opponents from the other team and a Fight Night Finale in December where boxers fight opponents from other gyms. The program is open to all levels, including absolute beginners. </p> 
					<p>Current members participate at no extra charge. Non-members must join the gym for the 3-month period. </p> 
					<p>Team Training focuses on extremely intense fitness training, boxing technique, footwork, speed and explosion training, as well as a very detailed introduction to defense, counter punching and overall sparring preparation. Sparring is not mandatory, but you will learn basics such as the strategy involved with dominating an opponent in the ring.</p>-->

					<h4>Fight Nights</h4>
					<p>Fight Nights, open to the public and free of charge, provide opportunities for members who don't have time to train for sanctioned bouts but are committed to the gym and work hard to hone their skills and compete in real bouts.</p>

					<p>Each participant will spar with another competitor of similar experience and attributes. A trainer will always be present in the ring during the bout to ensure a controlled experience.</p>
					
					<p>Preparation consists of participation in the Team Training program. Only members who have shown vast improvement and dedication during training will be eligible to spar on fight night. The trainers make the final decision on whether or not a participant is ready to compete in the show. Members must complete a qualifying orientation and private lessons, if required.</p>
