                    <h4>Boston Boxing &amp; Fitness</h4>

                    "assets/img/bg-slides/17.jpg">The boxer's workout is the
                    toughest regimen in sports and a great way to get into
                    shape. With a focus on strength and conditioning, boxing
                    offers a unique and motivating alternative to the standard
                    gym workout.</p>
                    <p>In addition to boxing, Boston Boxing & Fitness offers
                    classes, weight training and personal training. A fully
                    licensed, fully insured full-time Olympic boxing training
                    center sanctioned through USA Boxing, Inc., the gym is
                    staffed with trainers who are 100% focused on fitness and
                    safety.</p>
                    <p>Equipped with over 1,500 pounds of free weights, Boston
                    Boxing & Fitness provides a full weight training
                    experience. Our on-staff strength coaches will design a
                    conditioning and strengthening program specifically for
                    you.</p>
                    <p>Whether you are focused on boxing competitively or
                    recreationally we will train and prepare you with circuit
                    training; coordination and conditioning exercises, heavy
                    bag, speed bag and double-end bag drills, and one-on-one
                    mitt work with a trainer in the ring. You will be eligible
                    to spar, only after mastering proper stance, punches,
                    defense and conditioning.</p>
                    <p>Group classes taught by certified USA boxing instructors
                    are available for all levels, and include a stretch
                    designed to increase flexibility and prevent injury
                    followed by a series of circuit training exercises to
                    enhance coordination, strength and agility. Finally, you
                    will put on your gloves for bag work.</p>
                    <h4>Parking</h4>
                    <p>We have plenty of parking in the lot in front of the gym
                    as well as the lot next to the gym (fire fighter training
